# Final

Project Name: The Battles of Talarek

Project Description: Our project will include two different aspects of a D&D style game resembling a dungeon crawl. We will incorporate the choice aspect by creating what is almost a maze in order
to reach one of the final bosses. Players will first pick a desired character from a selection of about 2/3 characters. Each character will have different attacks and spells that will deal different
types of damage. From there the player will start to travel down a path where they will be able to make choices on the direction they want to go. Depending on what direction they choose will decide
how many mini battles they encounter and which boss they end up fighting. The mini battle monsters have 50 health, the small boss has 200 health, the medium boss has 350 health, and the large boss
has 500 health. The bosses will be able to attack the player with varying levels of damage based on probability and chance that is dependent on a random roll and the player's skill level. Based on the
combination of spells and attacks you use on the bosses will determine if the player is to kill the boss and win or die at the hands of the boss.
